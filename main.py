"""
(a) The mean, median, and standard deviation

(b) Draw boxplots of attributes in one frame.

(c) Draw pairplots.  For example, you can use   import seaborn as sns;    and then use  sns.pairplot()

(d) If the scatter plot shows a correlation among variables, then calculate the correlation.  We can use the following command for this purpose.

# calculate Pearson's correlation
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
# calculate Pearson's correlation between price and longitude 
corr, _ = pearsonr(X, y)
print('Pearsons correlation: %.3f' % corr)
